# Smart Label Product System

## Overview

The Smart Label Product System is a web-based platform designed to enhance product traceability, quality assurance, and supply chain transparency using QR code technology. This solution enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to track products in real time, verify authenticity, and access detailed product information at every stage of the supply chain.

## Features

* QR Code-Based Labeling: Generate unique QR codes for each product or batch, linking to detailed product data.
* Real-Time Traceability: Track products from manufacturing to end-user, ensuring transparency and accountability.
* Automated Quality Checks: Record and monitor quality assurance workflows for every product or batch.
* Analytics Dashboard: Visualize product movement, batch status, and quality trends with interactive charts and reports.
* Counterfeit Prevention: Instantly verify product authenticity by scanning QR codes.
* User-Friendly Interface: Manage products, batches, and analytics through an intuitive web dashboard.

## Applications

* Manufacturing and industrial supply chains
* Pharmaceutical and food safety compliance
* Retail and consumer goods authenticity
* Logistics and inventory management

## System Architecture

* Frontend: React.js, Material-UI
* Backend: Python (Flask), RESTful APIs
* Database: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL or MySQL (production)
* QR Code: Python `qrcode` for generation, `jsQR` for scanning
